DESRIPTION
"Monthly cost is 18284.75. The company is fully compromised with the project, so with the extended budget, we increased performance and availability:
- We have 5 RDS read replicas deployed as Multi-AZ for increased read performance and availability
- Master RDS deployed as Multi-AZ for increased availability
- All RDS instances are configured with Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) disks for increased I/O disk performance
- More powerful App Servers: instance type changed from g4ad.2xlarge to g4ad.8xlarge for improved performance
- More powerful Web Servers: instance type changed from t4g.xlarge to t4g.2xlarge
- Web servers increased from 7 to 10 instances (average) in the auto-scaling group"
