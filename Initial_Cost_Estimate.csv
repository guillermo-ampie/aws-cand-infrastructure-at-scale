DESCRIPTION
"Monthly cost is 9028.33. Our app uses powerful Application Servers (instance type: g4ad.2xlarge) with one GPU. It uses sophisticated Machine Learning models to give the users the best experience in image classification and speech recognition. 
- Our EC2 instances are On-demand ones. Our Finance Department is kind of wary about the costs of the application, and they want to have a more extensive user base to make longer commitments and choose reserved instances. 
- The number of Web Servers is seven, and the number of App Servers is ten as an average in the corresponding auto-scaling group."
