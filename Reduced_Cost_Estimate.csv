DESCRIPTION
"Monthly costs is: 5822.61. In this case, the primary goal was to maintain the overall user experience while meeting the budget constraints.  We convinced our Finance Department to keep the same processing power, storage capacity, and overall user experience while taking advantage of the different pricing models(for one and three-year commitments) offered by AWS: Reserved EC2 instances and EC2
Instance Savings Plans: 
- Web Server and App Servers with EC2 Instance Savings Plans 3 Year No Upfront: reduced costs and equal monthly payments for the overall three year period
- RDS (master and replicas instances) with  Reserved 1yr No Upfront: reduced costs and equal monthly payments for the overall one year period
- On the technical side, the only change was to make the RDS master instance Single-AZ, but because we are keeping the RDS Read replica, we will promote the read-replica in case of failure."
